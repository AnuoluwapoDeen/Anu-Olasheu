## Introducing Me 🧑🏽

Hi there 👋! I'm Anu, and I am a dedicated learner currently studying to transition into the field of Data Analysis. I am also a passionate SQL enthusiast based in the Netherlands.

I have over 5 years of professional experience in customer support, service, and sales. Currently, I am studying to transition into a Data Analysis role, which aligns with my passion for working with data.

I use SQL to query data in Salesforce and analyze past buying behavior, as well as forecast future sales on a monthly basis.

I thrive on learning new skills.

In my current position, I sell data quality software that helps to deduplicate, standardize, validate, and consolidate data in Salesforce CRM.
